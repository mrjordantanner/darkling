# Story
### Is this reality?

You "wake" to find yourself in an eerie landscape.  Strange voices fill the air, and the 
trees that surround you seem to be made of bones, or of something else not of this world.

Suddenly, your right arm is filled with a fiery pain.  Looking down in horror, you realize that your arm is gone,
instead replaced by some terrible demonic entity.  You can feel its evil power surging through you, burning like hellfire.  

Peering off into the distance, you can vaguely make out hordes of ghastly shapes rapidly approaching, while the infernal pain in your arm feels like it's about to explode...
